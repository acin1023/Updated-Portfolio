            Design a user-friendly website to simplify the process of booking an
            Airbnb home. In addition, the website needed to incorporate the
            additional services Della‚Äôs Realty Group offers. The design needed
            be seamless and easy to use amongst all users, regardless of their
            technical expertise.
            <br />
            The company also offers a credit repair service and free ebooks to
            assist users in repairing their credit. The company wanted to
            provide users with different avenues, all in one place, to help
            users repair their credit quickly and efficiently as possible.

          <h1 class="dellas__process-title">Design Process:</h1>
          <p class="dellas__process-description 1">
            I met with the company‚Äôs owner to discuss the goals of the company,
            how a website can help the company achieve it‚Äôs goals, the design
            layout of the website, and problems users were having booking a home
            or scheduling a consultation with the credit repair services.
          </p>
          <p class="dellas__process-description 2">
            The company's number one goal was to redirect traffic from their
            social media page to a credible and seamless website. As a person
            with vague design experience, I wanted to hand draw wireframes to
            guide me through my journey of creating a functional website. I
            mapped out individual webpages and added elements for users to
            easily navigate the website. I designed the website from a user's
            perspective while also keeping the owner's vision in my designs.
          </p>
          <p class="dellas__process-description 3">
            Once the wireframes were mapped out, i met with the owner to get
            some feedback on what can be improved. A few changes were made to
            the structure of the website to improve the user's experience. This
            was then implemented into Adobe XD to visualize the website. Once
            the structural components of the website were complete, I met with
            the owner again for feedback. The owner and I were in constant
            communication in order to bring the company's exact vision of the
            website to fruition. Some minor changes were made once again and
            then i was able to proceed to the aesthetic portion of the project.
          </p>
          <p class="dellas__process-description 4">
            Keeping the company's aesthetic vision of what the website should
            look like was challenging. I met with the owner to discuss how
            certain colors and design choices would make it harder for the user
            to navigate the website efficiently. One of the problems we
            discovered was the contrast of the words in comparison to the
            background made it difficult for readers to read. Another issue, was
            the color way. Their was no hierarchy for the colors to give
            importance and significance. We condensed the amount of colors used
            for the website. Lastly, the major issue was figuring out how much
            content to put on each page. The initial mockup has so much content
            that the user may have felt overwhelmed while navigating the
            website. We were able to come to a resolution and completed the
            website.

        <p class="result__description">
          Unfortunately the final design was unable to launch for final
          production. The owner resigned from her position and the company is no
          longer in business. Though this was not the desired outcome I had
          envisioned, I am very proud of the end product. I gained so much
          knowledge and experience working on my first major solo project. I
          also discovered the areas I can improve upon and I am very eager and
          excited to learn and develop more skills to advance my career in this
          field. I am very grateful to have been chosen to work on this design.
          The owner of the company loved the final design and we are open to
          collaborating once again on future designs.

            The Healthy Bites website was designed to provide users with healthy
            restaurant options. The website had to be efficient and user
            friendly. The website was designed to filter out unhealthy fast food
            chains and highlight local and small businesses that provide
            healthier food options.
          </p>
          <p class="project__one-description2">
            The target audience is for any locals, tourists, or individuals who
            are on the go looking for quick and healthy food options in their
            surrounding area.
